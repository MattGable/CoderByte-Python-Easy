# CoderByte-Python-Easy Solutions
These are solutions to some easy coding problems from [CoderByte.] (http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/Challenges)

#They're a little bit different from the site, though.
This code was written in IDLE, not the CoderByte interface. 
There will be some differences in terms of variable names, etc.
Only Python's (2.7.9 in this case) built-in functions were used 
to solve the problems, unless CoderByte suggested otherwise.
